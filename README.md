# nwFiddle

## Introduction

nwFiddle is a quick, ~~no~~ some thrills way to test NW.js code on jsFiddle. Now you can have all the wonderful helpful features of jsFiddle to help aid you in prototyping and troubleshooting NW.js code.

Features include:
* Ability to use local files
* Ability to test NW.js supported node.js/io.js code
* Sidebar hiding
* Zen Mode ([Preview](http://localabstract.com/zenmode.png))
* Fullscreen mode
* Dev tool launcher
* Everything jsFiddle has to offer
* Ability to hack at the jsFiddle UI*
* Ability to extend jsFiddle's features*

\* Currently the last two can only be done by modifying the nwFiddle source

## Setup

If you do not know of NW.js (formerly node-webkit) then you should know this source needs to be ran from a NW.js project. To get started goto the [NW.js website](http://nwjs.io/), download your target machines files, and follow the [packaging instructions provided by NW.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/wiki/How-to-package-and-distribute-your-apps) using the files you found here as your NW.js project directory.

## Security Notice

NW.js gives complete access to your machine. Obviously this means improper use of this tool can be dangerous. You should only be using your own fiddles and collaborate only with trusted individuals. I am not responsible for any damages caused by your misuse. Use at your own risk.
